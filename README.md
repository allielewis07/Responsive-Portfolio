** ** Responsive-Portfolio

 I created a Responsive Portfolio to demonstrate my work throughout developing. This site you'll be able to go to an About me, Contact sheet, and a portfolio page with links to sites i've created. On this same page there is a link where you can download my resume.
 
 This wesite is made up of 
 
 Bootstrap , 
 
 Css, 
 
 and Javascript.
