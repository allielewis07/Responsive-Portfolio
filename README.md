** ** Responsive-Portfolio ** **

 I created a Responsive Portfolio to demonstrate my work throughout developing. This site you'll be able to go to an About me, Contact sheet, and a portfolio page with links to sites i've created. On this same page there is a link where you can download my resume.
 
 This wesite is made up of :
 
* Bootstrap , 
 
 * Css, 
 
* and Javascript.
